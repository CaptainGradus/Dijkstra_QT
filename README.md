# Dijkstra_QT
This project is an implementation of Dijkstra algorithms on cpp with QT
When you run the app you will be suggested to fill in the table of the graph values. Then press ready ("готово") and draw ("нарисовать"). Now the graph is drawn and the shortest paths are calculated. If you want to find an individual path you should choose two vertexes.
You can run this app with Desktop Qt 5.11.0 MinGW 32.

### The table:
This is an example an empty table:

### The graph drawing
This is how to output looks like:

You can choose to draw only one solution:
